The Spring 2024 creative writing students quickly established our classroom as a space to share their imaginative ideas, and encourage their classmates to do likewise. Through regular in-class readings of their work, I watched the students’ confidence deepen and their creative abilities expand. I am proud to present a small fragment of the amazing work done this past semester here in this anthology. Among other assignments, students were asked to produce writing that was a conceptual or emotional extension of an untitled photograph by Jackson Bass, Kobo Abe’s Kangaroo Notebook, algorithmicvideo’s Ball Bouncing Around the Screen for 10 Hours, René Magritte’s The Collective Invention, and Juno Calypso’s Die Now, Pay Later. 

We will hold a small, on-campus event to celebrate the release of this anthology. Each student will read his or her own works aloud from the book. James Holden’s Imagine This Is a High Dimensional Space of All Possibilities will be played softly on a suitcase record player in the background as they read.
